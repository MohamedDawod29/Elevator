# Elevator
This repo presents an overview of the design and analysis of an elevator Finite State Machine (FSM). The FSM represents the behavior of an elevator system as a set of states and transitions, capturing the elevator's responses to external events and internal conditions. 
The FSM design aims to optimize elevator performance, minimize passenger waiting times, and ensure smooth and safe operation.
